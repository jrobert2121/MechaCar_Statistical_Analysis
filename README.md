# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview

## Purpose

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero  why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
write summary using screenshots of both summaries and address the following:
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
briefly summarize findings and my interpretation for the results.  include screenshots

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the mechacar performs against the competition.  think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer (cost, city or hwy fuel efficiency, hp, maint cost, or safety rating).  Address the following questions:
 - what metric or metrics will i test?
 - what is the null or alternative hypothesis?
 - what statistical test would be used to test the hypothesis and why
 - what data is needed to run the statistical test
